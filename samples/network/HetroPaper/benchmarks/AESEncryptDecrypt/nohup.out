Selected Platform Vendor : Multi2Sim
Device 0 : Multi2Sim Southern Islands GPU Model
Executing kernel for 1 iterations
-------------------------------------------
warning: Southern Islands GPU simulation stalled.
	The Southern Islands GPU has not completed execution of any in-flight
	instruction for 1M cycles. Most likely, this means that a
	deadlock condition occurred in the management of some modeled
	structure (network, memory system, pipeline queues, etc.).
